# Simultaneous Wireless Power Transfer and Near Field Communication (WPT + NFC)

This repository contains the electronic design and PCB files for the **“Simultaneous Wireless Power Transfer and Near Field Communication”** project, developed as a graduation project for the **Pontificia Universidad Javeriana Cali**.

## Project Description

This thesis presents the design and implementation of a system capable of integrating **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)** and **Near Field Communication (NFC)** into the **PhenoAgro** platform, which is used for crop phenotyping in agricultural environments.

The proposal arises from the need to **replace the current metal connection system**, which faces durability and reliability issues under adverse environmental conditions.  
The new design allows for the **simultaneous transmission of power and data via inductive coupling**, reducing mechanical vulnerability and increasing the system's robustness.
